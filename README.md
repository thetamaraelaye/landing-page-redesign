Landing Page Redesign Task

Introduction
This project is a redesign of the landing page of Crop2Cash. The current landing page design can be found here: www.crop2cash.com.ng. This redesign task was assigned to me during my internship at Crop2Cash. A figma design of the design was created by one of the interns and I was tasked with the responsibility of bringing the design to life.
